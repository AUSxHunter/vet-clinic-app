### 3. **Authentication Guards**

All protected pages already had authentication checks:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const id = getOwnerId();
  if (!id) {
    router.push("/");
  }
}, [router]);
```

**✅ Appointments** (`/appointments`)
- Same guard as above

```javascript
export const getOwnerId = () => localStorage.getItem("ownerId");
export const setOwnerId = (id) => localStorage.setItem("ownerId", id);

```

useEffect(() => {
  const id = getOwnerId();
  if (!id) {
    router.push("/");
  } else {
    setOwnerIdState(id);
  }
}, [router]);
