# Services Feature - Quick Start Guide

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important First Step

**Delete your existing database** (it has the old schema):

```bash
# From project root
rm vet-clinic/vet.db
```

Or on Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
Remove-Item vet-clinic\vet.db
```

The new schema uses:
- UUID strings for service IDs (instead of integers)
- `price_aed` field (instead of `price`)
- Many new fields (slug, category, tags, featured, etc.)

1. **Slug Generation:** When creating services in admin, slug auto-generates from name when you blur the name field

2. **Featured Services:** Toggle the star icon to show/hide services on home page spotlight

3. **Display Order:** Use up/down arrows to control sort order (lower numbers appear first)

4. **Tags:** Enter comma-separated tags in admin form (e.g., "exam, wellness, checkup")

5. **Fasting Flag:** Shows warning badge on service cards for procedures requiring fasting

6. **Bookable Flag:** Unchecked = "Not Bookable" button appears (useful for consultation-only services)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Services not showing?**
- Check backend is running on port 8000
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Verify services were seeded: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/services`

**"Service not found" when booking?**
- Ensure you deleted the old database
- Service IDs are now UUIDs, not integers
- Check the URL slug matches a real service

**Search not working in portfolio?**
- Clear your browser cache
- Check that services have tags populated
- Search looks at name, description, category, and tags

**Preselection not working?**
- Use the slug, not the ID: `/book?service=general-checkup`
- Check the slug exists in the database
- Look for toast notification confirming preselection
