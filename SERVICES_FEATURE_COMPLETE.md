---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Important: Database Reset Required

Since the Service model was significantly changed (ID type, field names), you'll need to reset your database:

**Option 1: Delete the database file (recommended for development)**
```bash
# From the project root
rm vet-clinic/vet.db
```

**Option 2: Keep existing data (advanced)**
If you have important owner/pet/appointment data, you'll need to:
1. Export your data
2. Delete the database
3. Let the app recreate tables with new schema
4. Manually re-import owners/pets (services will auto-seed)

### Start the Application

**1. Start Backend (Terminal 1)**
```bash
cd vet-clinic/backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**2. Start Admin Frontend (Terminal 2)**
```bash
cd vet-clinic/frontend/vet-frontend
npm run dev
```
Access at: http://localhost:3000

**3. Start User Frontend (Terminal 3)**
```bash
cd vet-clinic/vet-user
npm run dev
```
Access at: http://localhost:3001
